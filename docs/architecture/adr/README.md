# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the E-commerce Microservices Platform. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the development of this system.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. Each ADR describes:

- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change being proposed or made
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the [ADR template](000-adr-template.md)
2. Assign the next available number (e.g., 010-your-decision.md)
3. Fill in all sections thoroughly
4. Create a pull request for review
5. Update this README with the new entry

### ADR Numbering

- **000-099**: Core platform decisions
- **100-199**: Service-specific decisions
- **200-299**: Infrastructure and deployment
- **300-399**: Security and compliance
- **400-499**: Performance and optimization

## Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Decision is proposed but not yet accepted
- **Accepted**: Decision has been accepted and is in effect
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Decision Process

1. **Identify**: Recognize a decision point requiring documentation
2. **Research**: Investigate options and trade-offs
3. **Propose**: Create ADR draft with proposed decision
4. **Review**: Team reviews and provides feedback
5. **Decide**: Make final decision
6. **Document**: Update ADR with final decision
7. **Communicate**: Share with stakeholders

## Key Principles

When writing ADRs, follow these principles:

✅ **Be Concise**: Focus on the decision, not implementation details
✅ **Provide Context**: Explain why the decision was needed
✅ **List Alternatives**: Document what else was considered
✅ **State Consequences**: Both positive and negative
✅ **Include Dates**: When the decision was made
✅ **Link Related ADRs**: Create a web of decisions
✅ **Update Status**: Mark as superseded when replaced

## Benefits of ADRs

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures the "why" behind decisions
- **Onboarding**: Helps new team members understand architecture
- **Decision History**: Provides audit trail of architectural evolution
- **Avoid Repetition**: Prevents re-discussing settled questions
- **Context for Changes**: Explains rationale when modifying code
