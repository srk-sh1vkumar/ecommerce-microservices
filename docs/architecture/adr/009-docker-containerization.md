# ADR-009: Docker for Containerization

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-03-10

## Context

Need consistent deployment environments from development to production with isolated dependencies.

## Decision

Use **Docker** for containerization

**Rationale**:
- Consistent environments across dev, staging, production
- Dependency isolation
- Easy local development setup
- Integration with Kubernetes for orchestration
- Large ecosystem and tooling support

## Implementation

- **Base Image**: eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine (minimal JRE)
- **Multi-stage builds**: Separate build and runtime images
- **Compose**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for production

**Related**: Kubernetes deployment strategy (future ADR)
