**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team, Tech Lead
**Technical Story**: Initial platform architecture design

## Context and Problem Statement

The e-commerce platform needed to scale independently across different business capabilities (user management, product catalog, orders, cart) while allowing different teams to work autonomously. A monolithic architecture would create bottlenecks in development velocity and operational scalability.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for independent scalability of different business functions
- Requirement for team autonomy and parallel development
- Technology diversity for different services (e.g., different databases)
- Ability to deploy services independently without full system downtime
- Fault isolation to prevent cascading failures
- Microservices expertise within the team

## Considered Options

- **Option 1**: Monolithic Architecture
- **Option 2**: Microservices Architecture
- **Option 3**: Modular Monolith

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "Microservices Architecture"

**Justification**: Microservices provide the scalability, team autonomy, and deployment flexibility required for a growing e-commerce platform. The benefits of independent deployment and fault isolation outweigh the operational complexity.

### Positive Consequences

- Independent service scaling based on load (e.g., product service scales independently during catalog browsing)
- Team autonomy with clear service boundaries
- Technology diversity allowed (different databases, languages if needed)
- Fault isolation prevents complete system failure
- Faster deployment cycles for individual services
- Easier to understand and maintain smaller codebases

### Negative Consequences

- Increased operational complexity (monitoring, distributed tracing)
- Network latency between services
- Distributed transaction complexity
- Need for service discovery and API gateway
- More sophisticated deployment and orchestration required
- Data consistency challenges across services

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Monolithic Architecture

**Description**: Single deployable unit containing all business logic

**Pros**:
- Simpler deployment and operations
- Easier local development
- Simpler debugging and testing
- No network latency between components
- ACID transactions available
- Lower initial infrastructure cost

**Cons**:
- Limited scalability (scale entire application, not components)
- Team coordination overhead (shared codebase)
- Technology lock-in
- Longer deployment cycles
- Risk of cascading failures
- Difficult to maintain as codebase grows

### Option 2: Microservices Architecture âœ…

**Description**: Multiple independently deployable services organized around business capabilities

**Pros**:
- Independent scaling per service
- Team autonomy and parallel development
- Technology flexibility
- Independent deployment
- Fault isolation
- Easier to understand individual services

**Cons**:
- Operational complexity
- Distributed system challenges
- Network latency
- Data consistency complexity
- More infrastructure required
- Requires sophisticated monitoring

### Option 3: Modular Monolith

**Description**: Single deployable with well-defined internal modules

**Pros**:
- Simpler than microservices
- Enforced modularity
- Easier than monolith to eventually break apart
- Simpler transactions and debugging
- Lower operational overhead

**Cons**:
- Still limited scalability
- Shared technology stack
- Coupled deployment
- Risk of module boundaries erosion
- No fault isolation

## Implementation Details

### Service Boundaries

Services are organized by business capability:
- **User Service**: Authentication, user management
- **Product Service**: Product catalog, inventory
- **Cart Service**: Shopping cart, session management
- **Order Service**: Order processing, checkout
- **Notification Service**: Email/SMS notifications
- **Wishlist Service**: User wishlists

### Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for request-response patterns
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven for notifications (future implementation)
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka for dynamic service location
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway for unified entry point

### Data Management

- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **MongoDB**: Chosen for flexibility and scalability
- **Redis**: Shared caching layer for performance
